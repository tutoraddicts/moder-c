# VARAIBLES
Declearing varaibles is bit odd but still I did not find any other way to do this so here we go

## DECLEAR
    var(__return_type__, __variable_name__, __default_value__)
Let's see this with a example
    var(int, a, 0)
This syntax creating a int type variable name a with initial value 0
*you can also pass any functions too in replacement of 0*

***And Always remember here you do not have to specify any ; even if you specify I am not coming there to bite you :P you are good to go !haha***
